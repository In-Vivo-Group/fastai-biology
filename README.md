# Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Biology Edition
## Details on this repo 
Working through the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/) to create a resource for learning AI in biology. Updates to come. The first pass is just going through all the course resources and making sure everything still runs (it doesn't out of the box). Second pass will include new biology specific applications.
